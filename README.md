## About 
FAC bootcamp team project #3. A simple to do list tracker made with HTML, CSS & JS.  
Draw from the knowledge we have learned on these topics:
- Test driven development (TDD).
- Unit testing.
- Automated testing.
- Accessibility.
- Mobile first design.
- The ``` <template> ``` element.

## User stories

As a busy person, I want to:

- Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them.
- Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done.
- Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore.

As a motor-impaired user, I want to:

- Use all the features of the app without a mouse.

## Learning Outcomes
### Testing 
- [x] Check that passing a given input into our tests returns the expected output
- [x] Write tests to mimic the behaviour of a user performing different actions

### JS
- [x] Write testable, modular functions

- [x] Apply event listeners to HTML form elements
- [x] Use scope to control what variables are accessible inside functions and blocks
